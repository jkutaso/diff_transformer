# diff_transformer
Work in progress

The goal here is to reproduce this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05258

**Results**
Clearly diff transformer is better. Now we want to see by how much. Interesting that there is such variance for models of similar number of parameters. I think this is because parameters are more valuable in different parts of the model. I should look into this more.
